    <p>I think not socializing is unhealthy in the same way not drinking enough water is unhealthy, it's like a debuff. It makes you feel bad where get just enough to not feel the need to change anything. And you don't realize how much better things could be if you just filled up that status bar.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Have fewer spontaneous hobbies/projects
            <ul>
                <li>or at least fewer on the computer; prevent Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) and maybe get some exercise</li>
                <li>serotonin detox or something. go for a walk man no more 4 hours of youtube followed by project #793 bruh</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>there's no harm in treating yourself (responsibly)!</li>
        <li>exercise is addictive, so I've been told</li>
        <li>projects made for fun can be aimless and unplanned; if you're out of ideas, push it out of headspace for now. or maybe try to stop piling on so many projects?</li>
        <li>metacognition helps. are you having a panic attack?</li>
    </ul>
