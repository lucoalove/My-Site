    <ul>
        <li>simplify: your typical day should have you just eat well, exercise well, do schoolwork, and draw for fun</li>
        <li>Have fewer spontaneous hobbies/projects
            <ul>
                <li>or at least fewer on the computer; prevent Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) and maybe get some exercise</li>
                <li>serotonin detox or something. go for a walk man no more 4 hours of youtube followed by project #793 bruh</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>there's no harm in treating yourself (responsibly)!</li>
        <li>exercise is addictive, so I've been told</li>
        <li>projects made for fun can be aimless and unplanned; if you're out of ideas, push it out of headspace for now. or maybe try to stop piling on so many projects?</li>
        <li>metacognition helps. are you having a panic attack?</li>
    </ul>
